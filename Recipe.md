<b>RECIPE 🎂 :-</b>

<i>Chocolate Cake:</i>
Preheat oven to 350F, grease two 8" round baking pans and dust with cocoa powder. Line bottoms with parchment. <br>
Place all dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir to combine. <br>
In a medium bowl whisk all wet ingredients (pour hot water in slowly as not to cook the eggs). <br>
Add wet ingredients to dry and mix on medium for 2-3 mins. Batter will be very thin. <br>
Pour evenly into prepared pans. I used a kitchen scale to ensure the batter is evenly distributed. <br>
Bake for 45 mins or until a cake tester comes out mostly clean. <br>
Cool 10 minutes in the pans then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. <br>

<i>Cherry Liqueur Syrup:</i>
Place sugar and water into a small pot. Stir and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1 min then remove from heat. Stir in cherry liqueur and allow to cool completely.

<i>Whipped Cream Frosting:<</i>
Whip cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks. Ideally in a cold bowl with a cold whisk.

<i>Chocolate Bark:</i>
Melt chocolate over a double boiler or in 20 second bursts in the microwave. <br>
Using a large offset spatula, spread melted chocolate in a thin layer on a large sheet of parchment. <br>
Roll up from the short side of the parchment. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze until firm. <br>
Unroll to create chocolate bark. <br>

<i>Assembly:</i>
Cut each cake layer in half horizontally. <br>
Place one layer of cake on a cake stand or serving plate. Brush generously with cherry syrup. <br>
Top with approximately 1 cup whipped cream and spread evenly. Top with approximately 1 cup of cherries and gently press them into the whipped cream. Repeat with remaining 
layers and frost the outside of the cake. <br>
Decorate with chocolate bark, chocolate shavings, rosettes, and cherries if desired. <br>
