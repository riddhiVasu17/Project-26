<b>RECIPE ðŸŽ‚ :-</b>

 <i>Chocolate Cake:</i> <br>
â€¢ Preheat oven to 350F, grease two 8" round baking pans and dust with cocoa powder. Line bottoms with parchment. <br>
â€¢ Place all dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir to combine. <br>
â€¢ In a medium bowl whisk all wet ingredients (pour hot water in slowly as not to cook the eggs). <br>
â€¢ Add wet ingredients to dry and mix on medium for 2-3 mins. Batter will be very thin. <br>
â€¢ Pour evenly into prepared pans. I used a kitchen scale to ensure the batter is evenly distributed. <br>
â€¢ Bake for 45 mins or until a cake tester comes out mostly clean. <br>
â€¢ Cool 10 minutes in the pans then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. <br>

 <i>Cherry Liqueur Syrup:</i> <br>
â€¢ Place sugar and water into a small pot. Stir and bring to a boil. Simmer for 1 min then remove from heat. Stir in cherry liqueur and allow to cool completely.

 <i>Whipped Cream Frosting:</i>
â€¢ Whip cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks. Ideally in a cold bowl with a cold whisk.

 <i>Chocolate Bark:</i> <br>
â€¢ Melt chocolate over a double boiler or in 20 second bursts in the microwave. <br>
â€¢ Using a large offset spatula, spread melted chocolate in a thin layer on a large sheet of parchment. <br>
â€¢ Roll up from the short side of the parchment. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze until firm. <br>
â€¢ Unroll to create chocolate bark. <br>

 <i>Assembly:</i> <br>
â€¢ Cut each cake layer in half horizontally. <br>
â€¢ Place one layer of cake on a cake stand or serving plate. Brush generously with cherry syrup. <br>
â€¢ Top with approximately 1 cup whipped cream and spread evenly. Top with approximately 1 cup of cherries and gently press them into the whipped cream. Repeat with remaining 
â€¢ layers and frost the outside of the cake. <br>
â€¢ Decorate with chocolate bark, chocolate shavings, rosettes, and cherries if desired. <br>
